Project configuration
---------------------

Activate Python virtualenv and install required packages. At least Python 3.10 is required:
```bash
python3.10 -m pip install virtualenv
python3.10 -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To deactivate Python virtualenv run `deactivate`

> **NOTE:** Python virtualenv MUST be activated with `source venv/bin/activate` each time before using `esphome`

Firmware upload
---------------

> **NOTE:** First time upload should be performed via cable, all subsequent uploads could be performed Over-The-Air (OTA upload)

To build and upload firmware activate Python virtualenv and install packages from the `requirements.txt` as described in the [Project configuration](#project-configuration) section above and then run ESPHome:
```bash
esphome run train-pusher-client.yaml
```

In order to check device logs run:
```bash
esphome logs train-pusher-client.yaml
```

More details on ESPHome usage could be found via `esphome -h` command and on [the official website](https://esphome.io/)
